## Use Case Recommendations

### Choose Vercel If:

1. You want the simplest deployment experience with minimal configuration.
2. Global CDN and edge performance are critical requirements.
3. You need automatic preview deployments for PRs.
4. Your team size is small to medium.
5. Cold starts are acceptable for your use case.
6. Quick setup is more important than ultimate customization.

### Choose Coolify If:

1. You need complete control over your deployment infrastructure.

## Implementation Notes

### Vercel Implementation

- Use the included `scripts/deploy-vercel.sh` script for streamlined deployment.
- Configure build settings with specific environment variables in the Vercel dashboard.
- Set up automatic deployments from your GitHub repository.

### Coolify Implementation

- Set up a server with Docker and install Coolify.
- Configure the deployment settings using the `coolify.json` file.
- Use GitHub webhooks to trigger deployments on push.
- Consider setting up a CDN (like Cloudflare) in front of your application.

## Conclusion

Both Vercel and Coolify are excellent deployment options for the OSINT Dashboard, each with distinct advantages. The choice should be based on your specific requirements regarding performance, control, cost, and team expertise.

For most teams, Vercel provides the fastest path to production with excellent Next.js integration, while Coolify offers greater control and potentially better economics at scale for teams that can manage their own infrastructure.

We recommend starting with Vercel for rapid deployment and easy team collaboration, then considering Coolify as your application scales or if specific requirements around control and cold start avoidance become more important.
