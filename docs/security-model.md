# Security Model

This document outlines the security architecture and best practices implemented in the OSINT Dashboard & Agency Website project.

## Authentication & Authorization

### Authentication Flow

The project uses NextAuth.js integrated with Supabase for secure authentication:

1. **User Registration**:

   - Email/password registration with strong password requirements
   - Email verification required before account activation
   - Optional OTP verification for added security
   - Google reCAPTCHA v3 to prevent bot registrations

2. **Login Process**:

   - JWT-based authentication with secure token handling
   - Token refresh mechanism for extended sessions
   - Rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
   - Login activity logging for audit purposes

3. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**:

   - Optional Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP)
   - SMS or email-based verification codes
   - Recovery codes for account access if primary methods are unavailable

4. **Password Reset Flow**:
   - Time-limited reset tokens
   - One-time use tokens
   - Email verification required for reset completion
   - Activity logging for security monitoring

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

We implement a comprehensive RBAC system with the following roles:

1. **Super Admin**:

   - Complete system access
   - User management capabilities
   - Configuration and settings access
   - Analytics and reporting access

2. **Editor**:

   - Content creation and editing
   - Limited user management
   - No access to system configuration

3. **Contributor**:

   - Content creation capabilities
   - No publishing rights
   - No user management access

4. **Public User**:
   - Access to public content only
   - Cannot access admin dashboard

## Data Protection

### Data in Transit

- All API communications use HTTPS/TLS 1.2+
- Strict Transport Security (HSTS) enabled
- Certificate pinning for API communications

### Data at Rest

- Sensitive data encrypted in the database
- Password hashing using bcrypt with appropriate work factor
- No sensitive data stored in logs or cache

### Token Security

- JWTs stored in HTTP-only cookies
- CSRF protection implemented
- Short expiration times with refresh token rotation
- Session invalidation capabilities

## API Security

- Rate limiting on all endpoints
- Input validation using Zod
- Parameterized queries for database operations
- Proper error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information

## Infrastructure Security

### Logging & Monitoring

- Structured logging with sensitive data redaction
- Comprehensive audit logs for security-related events
- Real-time alerts for suspicious activities

### Security Headers

The application implements the following security headers:

- Content-Security-Policy (CSP)
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin

## Secure Development Practices

- Dependency scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- Regular security updates
- Code reviews with security focus
- Automated testing for security vulnerabilities

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. Immediately contain the breach
2. Assess the impact and severity
3. Document the incident details
4. Implement necessary fixes
5. Update security measures to prevent recurrence
6. Notify affected users if necessary

## Security Compliance

The application follows security best practices from:

- OWASP Top 10
- GDPR requirements
- General web application security standards

## Continuous Improvement

Our security model undergoes regular reviews and updates based on:

- Emerging threats and vulnerabilities
- Industry best practices
- Security testing and audit findings
- User feedback and incident reports

## Responsible Disclosure

We encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. Please report any security concerns to the project maintainers following our responsible disclosure policy.
