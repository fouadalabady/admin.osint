## 2. Environment Setup & Version Control

### 2.1 Local Development
- **Setup:**
  - Clone the repository from GitHub.
  - Install dependencies using:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
  - Create a `.env.local` file (refer to `.env.example`) and configure required environment variables.
  - Run the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
- **Best Practices:**
  - Use containerization or virtual environments to mirror production settings as closely as possible.
  - Ensure consistency by aligning your local environment with staging and production configurations.

### 2.2 Version Control with GitHub
- **Repository Management:**
  - All code is versioned on GitHub.
  - Use branching strategies (e.g., feature branches, Git Flow) to manage new features, bug fixes, and experiments.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Commit frequently with clear, descriptive messages.
  - Utilize pull requests for code reviews and merge processes.
  - Enforce pre-commit hooks, linters, and automated tests to maintain code quality.

### 2.3 Production with Coolify
- **Deployment Environment:**
  - Use Coolify as your production platform to deploy the latest stable releases.
  - Integrate Continuous Deployment (CD) pipelines with GitHub for automated builds and deployments.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Separate production, staging, and local environments.
  - Securely manage environment variables and rotate credentials regularly.
  - Consider blue-green or canary deployment strategies to mitigate risks during rollouts.

---

## 3. Continuous Integration & Delivery (CI/CD)

### 3.1 Automated Pipelines
- **Build & Test:**
  - Set up CI pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions) to automatically run unit, integration, and end-to-end tests on every commit.
  - Prioritize coverage of critical modules such as authentication, form handling, and email workflows.
- **Deployment Automation:**
  - Configure CD pipelines to push changes to Coolify after successful tests and code reviews.
  - Use approval gates for production deployments where necessary.

### 3.2 Rollback & Recovery
- Plan for automated rollback strategies in case of deployment failures.
- Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring (handled outside this document) to quickly diagnose and respond to issues.

---

## 4. Security & Compliance

### 4.1 Application Security
- **Authentication & Authorization:**
  - Use NextAuth.js with Supabase for secure authentication.
  - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for managing different user types (Super Admin, Editor, Contributor).
  - Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and OTP verification for high-risk operations.
- **Data Protection:**
  - Encrypt data in transit (TLS/SSL) and at rest.
  - Store tokens in HTTP-only cookies with secure token refresh mechanisms.

### 4.2 Infrastructure Security
- **Logging & Auditing:**
  - Utilize structured logging (e.g., with Pino) to capture detailed system and user events.
  - Maintain immutable audit logs for sensitive actions.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:**
  - Integrate SIEM platforms to monitor logs and trigger alerts for anomalous activities.

---

## 5. Developer & Operational Guidance

### 5.1 Documentation & Developer Onboarding
- **Project Documentation:**
  - Keep the project roadmap, README, and additional docs (e.g., [Project Architecture](docs/project-architecture.md), [Security Model](docs/security-model.md)) updated.
- **Onboarding:**
  - Ensure new team members understand the project structure, local setup, and CI/CD workflows.
  - Provide clear guidelines for local Supabase setup and environment configurations.

### 5.2 UI Component & Code Standards
- **UI Components:**
  - Use only the components provided by [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) to ensure design consistency.
- **Coding Practices:**
  - Follow auto-formatting guidelines (Prettier, ESLint) and use strong typing (TypeScript recommended) to minimize runtime errors.

---

## 6. Production Environment Sanitization & DevOps Enhancements

This section outlines specific guidelines for maintaining a clean production environment and incorporates additional DevOps details:

- **Separation of Concerns:**  
  - Ensure that production builds and deployments are free of any development-specific instructions, debug logs, or test endpoints.
  - Remove local development commands and instructions from production documentation and build artifacts.

- **Production Build Hygiene:**  
  - Implement build scripts that strip out development-only comments, debugging code, and testing frameworks.
  - Use environment-specific configurations to guarantee that development tools and instructions are not included in production bundles.

- **DevOps Enhancements:**  
  - Automate the cleaning process as part of the CI/CD pipeline, ensuring that the production version is always sanitized.
  - Regularly review build and deployment scripts to confirm that no inadvertent development instructions remain.
  - Monitor production logs for any residual debug or development messages, enforcing immediate cleanup if found.

- **Documentation Standards:**  
  - Maintain separate documentation for development and production environments.
  - Ensure that production documentation contains only operational details and secure configuration steps.

## 7. Environment Variables & Configuration

### 7.1 Key Environment Variables
| **Variable**            | **Description**                                           | **Example**                     |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| `NEXTAUTH_URL`          | Base URL for NextAuth.js configuration                    | `https://yourapp.com`           |
